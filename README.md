# Can you predict the quality of wine?

##Hello and welcome!  
This report examines data on red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The primary goal is to determine the factors most predictive of quality of wine on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the best quality of wine. The predictor variables include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acidity, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol for a total of 11 physiochemical properties to work with. Unfortunately, the data set did not specify the units on any of the predictor variables. There are a total of 1,599 observations in the data set.
